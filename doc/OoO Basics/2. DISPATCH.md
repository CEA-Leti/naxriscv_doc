## Description

![[OoO core schematic DISPATCH|600]]

#### Reservation Stations

Instructions in reservation stations are dispatched, when :
- They have all the values of their operands
- The associated execution unit is free

When an instruction is dispatched, its reservation station slot becomes free.

## Example

We will use the same example as [[1. ISSUE]] stage, and begin in cycle 1 after the first instruction is issued.

- Issue 1 instruction per cycle
- ADD : 1 cycle
- MUL : 10 cycles
- DIV : 40 cycles
- LD : 100 cycles

#### Cycle 1 

The first instruction is in its reservation station, as its operand is available in register file, and LSU is free, we can dispatch it in the next cycle.

![[Dispatch 0|600]]

#### Cycle 2 

**1)** Next instruction is issued in its reservation station as explained in [[1. ISSUE]].

**2)** Previous instruction is dispatched in the LSU unit, it will take 100 cycles to complete the load.
	At the same time, the LSU reservation station slot becomes free.

**3)** The second instruction is in its reservation station, as its operands are not all available in register file or ROB, we cannot dispatch it in the next cycle.

![[Dispatch 1|600]]

#### Cycle 3

**1)** Next instruction is issued in its reservation station as explained in [[1. ISSUE]].

**2)** Previous instruction cannot be dispatched in the ADD unit, so it waits in its reservation station until ROB 1 value is available. This value will be available when LSU completes its load.

**3)** The third instruction is in its reservation station, as its operands are not all available in register file or ROB, we cannot dispatch it in the next cycle.

![[Dispatch 2|600]]

#### Cycle 4

**1)** Next instruction is issued in its reservation station as explained in [[1. ISSUE]].

**2)** Previous instruction cannot be dispatched in the MUL unit, so it waits in its reservation station until ROB 2 value is available. This value will be available when ADD completes its execution.

**3)** The DIV instruction is in its reservation station, as its operands are available in register file, and the MUL unit is free, we can dispatch it in the next cycle.

![[Dispatch 3|600]]

#### Cycle 5

**1)** Previous instruction is dispatched in the MUL unit, it will take 40 cycles to complete the division.
	At the same time, the MUL reservation station slot becomes free.

>**NB :** That's here, that we see the **out-of-order** execution
>Because the DIV instruction executes even if there are instructions before it, that are not yet executed. Thus, instead of waiting for an instruction to complete, we can execute other instructions and increase performance.

**2)** Since the issue queue is empty, and the busy reservation stations are waiting for operands, there is nothing to dispatch until cycle 103. (Load begins in cycle 2 and completes after 100 cycles)
Before the cycle 103, the DIV instruction ends its execution, we see it in [[3. BROADCAST]].

![[Dispatch 4|600]]


#### Cycle 103

**1)** In the previous cycle, the load instruction completes, so the ROB 1 has its value.

**2)** The ADD instruction has all its operands now available, and as the ADD unit is free, we can dispatch it. It will take 1 cycle to complete the addition.
At the same time, the ADD reservation station slot becomes free.

**3)** The last busy reservation station is waiting for operands, there is nothing to dispatch until cycle 105.

![[Dispatch 5|600]]

#### Cycle 105

**1)** In the previous cycle, the ADD instruction completes, so the ROB 2 has its value.

**2)** The MUL instruction has all its operands now available, and as the MUL unit is free, we can dispatch it. It will take 10 cycles to complete the multiplication.
At the same time, the MUL reservation station slot becomes free.

![[Dispatch 6|600]]

#### Next Cycles

DISPATCH ends in cycle 105, and other stages will use the next cycles.
