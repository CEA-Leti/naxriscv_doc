## Description

![[OoO core schematic COMMIT|600]]


Instructions are in program order in the ROB. As there is an ISSUE pointer, there is also a **COMMIT pointer** that increments with each commit. That's why, instructions are committed in program order.

#### Register file

At each commit, we update the register file with the ROB entry associated to the commit. As we modify the register file, it's important to proceed in program order. 
Because if an out-of-order instruction modify the register file and if it causes an exception, it will be impossible to come back to the state before this exception.

#### Register Allocation Table

At each commit, we also update the RAT with the ROB entry associated to the commit. But this update is not done every time, it depends on the ROB entry stored in the RAT, if :
- the ROB entry in the RAT = the ROB committed, we update the RAT, to link to register file.
- the ROB entry in the RAT != the ROB committed, we don't update the RAT, because that means that there is a newer ROB entry in the RAT.

#### ReOrder Buffer

After the two previous operations, the ROB slot becomes free and the commit pointer is incremented.


## Example

We will use the same example as [[1. ISSUE]] stage, [[2. DISPATCH]] stage and [[3. BROADCAST]] stage, and begin in cycle 45, when there is the first instruction broadcast..

- Issue 1 instruction per cycle
- ADD : 1 cycle
- MUL : 10 cycles
- DIV : 40 cycles
- LD : 100 cycles

#### Cycle 45 

**1)** The division result is available, it is broadcast to the ROB to store it. As no reservation stations wait for this result, we don't need to broadcast it to them.

**2)** The MUL unit becomes free to execute another instruction.

The load instruction will be the next to complete in cycle 102.

![[Commit 0|600]]
___
#### Cycle 46

As the DIV instruction was broadcast in the previous cycle, we should commit this instruction now. However, the commit pointer, in the ROB, is not yet at this instruction, because we have not committed the instructions before.

So, the next instruction to be committed, will be the load instruction in cycle 103.
___
#### Cycle 103

The load instruction was broadcast in the previous cycle, we can commit it now.

**1)** Update R1 in the register file with the ROB 1 value.
**2)** In the RAT, the R1 entry is still associated with ROB 1, so we update the RAT to link the R1 entry with the register file.
**3)** Clear the ROB 1 slot, and increment the commit pointer.

The next instruction to be committed, will be the ADD instruction in cycle 105.

![[Commit 1|600]]
___
#### Cycle 105

The ADD instruction was broadcast in the previous cycle, we can commit it now.

**1)** Update R4 in the register file with the ROB 2 value.
**2)** In the RAT, the R4 entry is not associated with ROB 2, so we must not update the RAT, because instructions after the ADD instruction could use the wrong value.
**3)** Clear the ROB 2 slot, and increment the commit pointer.

The next instruction to be committed, will be the MUL instruction in cycle 116.

![[Commit 2|600]]
___
#### Cycle 116

The MUL instruction was broadcast in the previous cycle, we can commit it now.

**1)** Update R4 in the register file with the ROB 3 value.
**2)** In the RAT, the R4 entry is still associated with ROB 3, so we update the RAT to link the R4 entry with the register file.
**3)** Clear the ROB 3 slot, and increment the commit pointer.

The next instruction to be committed, will be the DIV instruction in the next cycle, because this instruction has already been executed and is only waiting for commit.

![[Commit 3|600]]
___
#### Cycle 117

After waiting, the DIV instruction can be committed now.

**1)** Update R6 in the register file with the ROB 4 value.
**2)** In the RAT, the R6 entry is still associated with ROB 4, so we update the RAT to link the R6 entry with the register file.
**3)** Clear the ROB 4 slot, and increment the commit pointer. The issue pointer and the commit pointer are in the same level now. This is proof that we have finished processing all the instructions.

After 117 cycles, we finished the processing of the 4 instructions.
