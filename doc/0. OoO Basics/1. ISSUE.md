## Description

![[OoO core schematic ISSUE|600]]

#### Reservation Stations

Instructions are issued to the reservation stations associated with the execution unit targeted.
-  ADD instructions => reservation station associated with ADD unit
-  MUL instructions => reservation station associated with MUL unit
- LD instructions => reservation station associated with LD unit
- etc

Instructions are issued, if there is a free reservation station.
For example, if all ADD reservation stations are busy, we cannot issue an ADD instruction. And since we process in order in this state, we cannot issue any instruction. 

#### ReOrder Buffer

When the instruction is issued, we reserve also a ROB slot, to store the future result of that instruction.

#### Register Allocation Table

When the instruction is issued, we update the RAT, to link the ROB slot with the destination register.

## Example

In this example, we focus only in ISSUE stage.

- Issue 1 instruction per cycle
- ADD : 1 cycle
- MUL : 10 cycles
- DIV : 40 cycles
- LD : 100 cycles

#### Cycle 0 

![[Issue 0|600]]

#### Cycle 1 

**1)** First instruction is a LOAD, so the LSU reservation station will be used. 
	As there is free slots in LSU reservation station, the instruction can be issued to it.
	- The physical destination register is the ROB slot.
	- Physical source register 1 = Architectural source register 1, as R5 slot in the RAT is empty. There is no renaming, we take the value in the register file.

**2)** The ROB slot indicated by the issue pointer is reserved, and filled with the correct data.
	The issue pointer is incremented

**3)** The RAT is updated, to link the destination register R1 with ROB 1, where the operation result will be stored.

![[Issue 1|600]]

#### Cycle 2

**1)** Next instruction is an ADD, so the ADD reservation station will be used. 
	As there is free slots in ADD reservation station, the instruction can be issued to it.
	- The physical destination register is the ROB slot.
	- Physical source register 2 = Architectural source register 2, as R3 slot in the RAT is empty. There is no renaming, we take the value in the register file.
	- Physical source register 1 != Architectural source register 1, because R1 is renamed to ROB1, to take into account the result of the previous instruction.

>**NB :** We have here a Read-After-Write dependency with the previous instruction. 
>The reservation station will wait until ROB 1 value is available to dispatch the instruction.

**2)** The ROB slot indicated by the issue pointer is reserved, and filled with the correct data.
	The issue pointer is incremented.

**3)** The RAT is updated, to link the destination register R4 with ROB 2, where the operation result will be stored.

![[Issue 2|600]]

#### Cycle 3

**1)** Next instruction is a MUL, so the MUL reservation station will be used. 
	As there is free slots in MUL reservation station, the instruction can be issued to it.
	- The physical destination register is the ROB slot.
	- Physical source register 2 = Architectural source register 2, as R6 slot in the RAT is empty. There is no renaming, we take the value in the register file.
	- Physical source register 1 != Architectural source register 1, because R4 is renamed to ROB 2, to take into account the result of the previous instruction.

>**NB :** We have here a Read-After-Write dependency with the previous instruction. 
>The reservation station will wait until ROB 2 value is available to dispatch the instruction.

**2)** The ROB slot indicated by the issue pointer is reserved, and filled with the correct data.
	The issue pointer is incremented.

**3)** The RAT is updated, to link the destination register R4 with ROB 3, where the operation result will be stored.

>**NB :** We have here a Write-After-Write dependency. The RAT update removes ROB 2 from RAT, but  it's not a problem. 
>All instructions that are not yet executed, and need the old value of R4 will find it in the ROB. That's why we write ROB id in reservation stations.
>So, this MUL instruction, will take for R4 value, the ROB 2 value.

**Thanks to registers renaming, we remove WAW dependencies between instructions.**

#### Cycle 4

**1)** Next instruction is a DIV, so the MUL reservation station will be used. 
	As there is free slots in MUL reservation station, the instruction can be issued to it.
	- The physical destination register is the ROB slot.
	- Physical source register 2 = Architectural source register 2, as R7 slot in the RAT is empty. There is no renaming, we take the value in the register file.
	- Physical source register 2 = Architectural source register 2, as R8 slot in the RAT is empty. There is no renaming, we take the value in the register file.

**2)** The ROB slot indicated by the issue pointer is reserved, and filled with the correct data.
	The issue pointer is incremented.

**3)** The RAT is updated, to link the destination register R6 with ROB 4, where the operation result will be stored.

>**NB :** We have here a Write-After-Read dependency. As the DIV instruction, will not wait for data to execute. 
>So it could execute before the MUL instruction, and write the result in R6 before the MUL instruction read it. But as we write the result in ROB 4 and not in R6, there is no problem.

**Thus, thanks to registers renaming, we remove WAR dependencies between instructions.**

#### Next Cycles

ISSUE ends in cycle 4, and other stages will use the next cycles.
