> **State where the results from the execution units are broadcast to the reservation stations and the ROB.**

## Description

![[OoO core schematic BROADCAST|600]]


When an execution unit completes its processing, the result is broadcast, that means :
- Store the result in the associated ROB slot.
- Send the result to all the reservation stations that need it.

## Example

We will use the same example as [[1. ISSUE]] stage and [[2. DISPATCH]] stage, and begin in cycle 44, 1 cycle before the first completion of an execution.

- Issue 1 instruction per cycle
- ADD : 1 cycle
- MUL : 10 cycles
- DIV : 40 cycles
- LD : 100 cycles

#### Cycle 44 

The DIV instruction is the first instruction that ends its execution, we can broadcast its result in the next cycle.

![[Broadcast 0|600]]

#### Cycle 45 

**1)** The division result is available, it is broadcast to the ROB to store it. As no reservation stations wait for this result, we don't need to broadcast it to them.

**2)** The MUL unit becomes free to execute another instruction.

The load instruction will be the next to complete in cycle 102.

![[Broadcast 1|600]]

#### Cycle 102 

**1)** The load result is available, it is broadcast to the ROB to store it. As the ADD reservation station wait for this result, we broadcast it to this reservation station.

**2)** The LSU unit becomes free to execute another instruction.

The ADD instruction will be the next to complete in cycle 104.

![[Broadcast 2|600]]

#### Cycle 104 

**1)** The addition result is available, it is broadcast to the ROB to store it. As the MUL reservation station wait for this result, we broadcast it to this reservation station.

**2)** The ADD unit becomes free to execute another instruction.

The MUL instruction will be the next to complete in cycle 115.

![[Broadcast 3|600]]

#### Cycle 115 

**1)** The multiplication result is available, it is broadcast to the ROB to store it. As no reservation stations wait for this result, we don't need to broadcast it to them.

**2)** The MUL unit becomes free to execute another instruction.

#### Next Cycles

BROADCAST ends in cycle 115, and COMMIT, the last stage, will use the next cycles.
